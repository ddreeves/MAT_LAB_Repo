# 🧪 Malware Analysis & Cybersecurity Research Lab

Welcome to the official repository for my custom-built **Malware Analysis Lab**, designed to improve cybersecurity skills, reverse engineering techniques, and threat detection capabilities.

This lab is powered by a repurposed PC running **Proxmox VE** with multiple virtual machines for offensive and defensive security research. Here, you'll find YARA and Sigma detection rules, setup scripts, and documentation for malware analysis workflows and detection engineering.
